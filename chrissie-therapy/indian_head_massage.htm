<p><strong>What is Indian Head Massage?</strong><br></p>
<p>Indian Head Massage is an ancient art originating from a traditional Indian system of medicine known as Ayurveda, a very old form of healing dating back hundreds of years, whose texts detail the importance of massage.</p>

<p>It is a truly holistic therapy that aims to balance the mind, body and spirit by massage and stimulation to the upper back, shoulders, neck, face and scalp.   In addition to the following short term beneficial effects, it can also achieve long term improvements.  It is carried out through clothing, with the client sitting on an upright chair, so there is no need to undress.  The use of coconut oil is optional if improved hair condition is desired.</p>
